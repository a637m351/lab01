A long long time ago
in a galaxy far away
a git repository 
was initialized

but the student
ran the first command
in the wrong directory
and so then he initialized it with a verbose message explaining the empty commit beforehand.

However, the student was rescued by han solo, who arrived to fix his git log.
Just kidding.
